## Asking for help on Stack Overflow
A good question will include all the following:
- A description of the problem (what are you trying to do? what results are you expecting? what results are you actually getting?)
- The code you are using (only post the relevant code)
- The output of your method call(s)
- Any error message(s) you are getting

# Before to ask a question
