  <h3>Express Checkout PayPal: Configure &rarr; Express Checkout</h3>

<p>PayPal Express Checkout is automatically pre-configured for ClicShopping installations where payments are sent to the configured store owner e-mail address. This allows store owners to start accepting payments immediately and to complete their PayPal merchant account when their first payments have arrived.</p>

<p>This module can use both PayPal and Payflow to process transactions with and can be configured on the <span class="label label-default">Configure</span> &rarr; <span class="label label-info">General</span> page.</p>

<h4>Features</h4>

<h5>Seamless Checkout</h5>

<p>Seamless Checkout requires the Log In with PayPal module to be enabled and allows customers who have logged in through PayPal to proceed straight to the Express Checkout flow without needing to log in again.</p>

<h5>Instant Update</h5>

<p>As soon as the customer has logged in at PayPal or has provided their shipping address during the Express Checkout flow, PayPal contacts your online store to retrieve a list of applicable shipping rates and taxes for the shipping destination. The customer is able to choose their preferred shipping rate which is passed back to the store to use for the order.</p>

<p>ClicShopping can be block orders when no shipping rate for the destination is available. If this is enabled and Instant Update detects that no shipping rates are available, it requests the customer to select or enter a new shipping address during the Express Checkout flow and prevents them to continue with the order until a valid shipping destination has been selected.</p>

<h6>Requirements</h6>

<p>Instant Update requires the following for the shipping rates to be retrieved:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your store installation must be configured for and have SSL enabled.</li>
</ul>

<h5>PayPal Account Optional</h5>

<p>PayPal Account Optional allows customers without a local or PayPal account to proceed through the Express Checkout flow as a guest. Customers do not need to create a PayPal account during the Express Checkout flow and their shipping and billing information is passed back to the store to use for the order.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<h5>Customer Accounts</h5>

<p>PayPal Express Checkout allows guest purchases to be made without the customer needing to create or log into their local store account. A local customer account is however created when they return back to the store from the Express Checkout flow to keep track of the order.</p>

<p>If the Set Password account content module is not installed, the automatically created account is assigned a randomly generated password which is e-mailed to the customers e-mail address PayPal provides.</p>

<p>If the Set Password account content module is installed, the password is left empty and no e-mail is sent to the customer. The customer then has the opportunity to set their own password in the My Account page during their session or they will only able to log in again through Log In with PayPal or PayPal Express Checkout when their next order is made.</p>

<h5>Order Processing</h5>

<p>The Express Checkout module has been developed to have the customer return back to the store to finalize their order on the checkout confirmation page. This allows the correct order totals and taxes to be shown for confirmation and for additional checks to be added before the order is processed (eg, agree to terms checkbox).</p>

<h5>Line Items</h5>

<p>Each product that is ordered is passed on to PayPal as line items to show to the customer during the Express Checkout flow. This includes extra third-party Order Total modules that manipulate the order total values (eg, discounts). In rare occassions, when the line items, shipping, and tax calculations do not match the order total value, only the order total value is passed onto PayPal without the line items.</p>

  <h3>Payments Standard PayPal: Configure &rarr; Payments Standard</h3>

<div class="alert-warning" role="alert">It is recommended to enable Payment Data Transfer (PDT) in your PayPal account settings to ensure transactions can be verified after payments have been made.</div>

<h4>Features</h4>

<h5>Encrypted Website Payments</h5>

<p>Encrypted Website Payments allows the initial transaction information to be encrypted using public and private keys before it is sent to PayPal. This protects the order information from being tampered with and securely initiates the transaction with PayPal.</p>

<h6>Requirements</h6>

<p>Encrypted Website Payments requires the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>OpenSSL; The PHP installation on your web server needs to support OpenSSL or have access to the "openssl" program file. The location of the "openssl" program file can be defined in a configuration parameter.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Instant Payment Notification</h5>

<p>All orders processed through PayPal Payments Standard are verified by a separate call PayPal automatically performs when an order has been processed. PayPal sends an Instant Payment Notification (IPN) to your store with the order information which is then verified and logged with the order.</p>

<h5>Payment Data Transfer (PDT)</h5>

<p>If Payment Data Transfer has been enabled in your PayPal account settings, transactions are verified with an Identity Token when the customer returns back to the online store after a payment has been made.</p>

<p>As soon as Payment Data Transfer has been enabled at PayPal, it is important to copy the generated Identity Token to the configuration parameter setting.</p>

<h6>6. Block non-encrypted website payments.</h6>

<p>Optionally, orders processed through non-encrypted website payments can be blocked for extra security. This is recommended only if Encrypted Website Payments has been enabled.</p>

<p>To block payments from unprotected and non-encrypted PayPal Payments Standard orders:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Log in to your PayPal Premier account or Business account.</li>
  <li>Click the Profile subtab.</li>
  <li>In the Hosted Payment Settings column, click the Website Payments Preferences link.</li>
  <li>Scroll down to the Encrypted Website Payments section.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="5">
  <li>Next to the Block Non-encrypted Website Payment label, select the On radio button.</li>
  <li>Scroll to the bottom of the page, and click the Save button.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<h5>Order Processing</h5>

<p>When the customer goes through the checkout procedure and lands on the checkout confirmation page, their order is saved in the database with a private order status (by default, <em>Preparing [PayPal Standard]</em>). The order status is updated to an acknowledged order status (by default, the default order status level) when the customer returns back to the store from PayPal after payment has been made, or when the IPN notification is received if the customer didn't return back to the store.</p>

<p>If the customer did not finalize the payment at PayPal and does not return back to the store, the order remains in the database with the <em>Preparing [PayPal Standard]</em> order status and can be safely deleted after a period of time.</p>

<h5>Line Items</h5>

<p>Each product that is ordered is passed on to PayPal as line items to show to the customer during the payment flow. This includes extra third-party Order Total modules that manipulate the order total values (eg, discounts). In rare occassions, when the line items, shipping, and tax calculations do not match the order total value, only the order total value is passed onto PayPal without the line items.</p>

  <h3>Log In with PayPal PayPal: Configure &rarr; Log In</h3>

<p>Log In with PayPal allows guests to authenticate themselves through PayPal and to securely share their personal and shipping address information without the need to create a customer account on your store. The shared information is used to calculate taxes and to retrieve a list of available shipping rates for their order based on their shipping address.</p>

<p>When guests authenticate themselves through PayPal, their default payment method is automatically set to PayPal Express Checkout which they can use without needing to sign into again.</p>

<strong>Log In with PayPal Mini-Browser Window</strong></p>

<h4>Features</h4>

<h5>Seamless Checkout</h5>

<p>Seamless Checkout requires the PayPal Express Checkout module to be enabled and allows customers who have logged in through PayPal to proceed straight to the Express Checkout flow without needing to log in again.</p>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>Log In with PayPal requires the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>PayPal REST App; a PayPal REST App needs to be created at the <a href="https://developer.paypal.com" target="_blank">PayPal Developer</a> site. The Client ID and Secret API credentials assigned to the application need to be entered in the module configuration page.</li>
  <li>The Return URL displayed in the module configuration page needs to be entered as the Return URL in the PayPal REST App created for Log In with PayPal.</li>
  <li>Set Password Content Module; it is important to enable the Set Password content module to automatically replace the My Account -> Change Password link to a Set Password link.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<h5>Customer Accounts</h5>

<p>Log In with PayPal allows guest purchases to be made without the customer needing to create or log into their local store account. As a customer account is needed to track orders, when the customer returns back to the store after logging in through PayPal, either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they are automatically logged into their store account matching the same e-mail address, or</li>
  <li>a store account based on their PayPal e-mail address is automatically created with an empty password</li>
</ul>

<p>Customers cannot log into automatically created store accounts until they set a password on the My Account -> Set Password page, and can continue to log in through PayPal until a password has been set.</p>

<div class="note">Please note that the sharing of customer email addresses does not authorize your business to email consumers. For any communications not related to a purchase (such as marketing emails, newsletters, and offers), you must continue to present your customers with separate opt-in/out options.</div>

  <h3 class="notoc">Order Administration</h3>

<p>The PayPal App adds a dedicated <span class="label label-info">PayPal</span> tab to the orders management page for orders that were purchased through a PayPal App payment module. This adds the following functionality to the order administration page:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Full or partial capture of authorizated transactions</li>
  <li>Full or partial refunds of captured transactions</li>
  <li>Cancelling authorized transactions</li>
  <li>Retrieving the current status of the transaction</li>
</ul>

<strong><em>The redesigned order administration page with a tabbed interface</em></strong></p>

<p>The PayPal tab displays additional action buttons depending on the current state of the order.</p>

<p><br /><strong><em>Additional order action buttons in the PayPal tab</em></strong></p>

<p>Capturing authorized transactions can occur in whole or through partial amounts. If authorized transactions are captured partially, an option is available to release the remaining amount if the remaining amount is not to be captured for the order.</p>

<p><br /><strong><em>Capturing a transaction in whole or partially</em></strong></p>

<p>As soon as an order administration action is performed, the order information page is reloaded with a status notification of the action being shown at the top of the page and for successful actions, additional transactional information is stored as an order status comment.</p>

<p><br /><strong><em>Performing a partial capture on an authorized transaction</em></strong></p>

<p>The PayPal App detects that the current status of the order has changed and now displays a refund button to be able to refund captured authorizations.</p>
