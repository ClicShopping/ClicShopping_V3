- Positive Score (Greater than 0): A positive recommendation score indicates that the product is likely to be recommended to the user. A higher positive score often implies a stronger recommendation. The magnitude of the score can represent the level of confidence in the recommendation.<br />
- Neutral Score (Close to 0): A score close to 0 may imply that the recommendation algorithm is not strongly biased towards or against recommending the product. It might indicate a neutral or uncertain recommendation.<br />
- Negative Score (Less than 0): A negative score suggests that the product is less likely to be recommended. The lower the negative score, the stronger the indication that the product is not a good fit for the user.<br /><br />
<strong>- Option 1:</strong> Range-Based Recommendation<br>
Range-Based Recommendation is a type of recommendation strategy that focuses on the numerical ranges or thresholds of various factors to determine the suitability of a product for a user. In this approach, different product attributes such as user ratings, review scores, and user feedback are assigned specific weightings and combined to calculate a recommendation score. The recommendation score is then compared against predefined ranges or thresholds to determine the level of recommendation for a particular product. For example, products with recommendation scores falling within a specific range may be considered as highly recommended, moderately recommended, or not recommended at all.<br /><br />
<strong>- Option 2:</strong> Multiple-Sources Recommendation<br>
Multiple-Sources Recommendation is a recommendation strategy that leverages multiple data sources or information channels to generate personalized recommendations for users. Instead of relying solely on user-specific data (e.g., user ratings or feedback), this approach considers a wide range of data from diverse sources, such as user behavior, social networks, item features, and contextual information. By combining information from various sources, the recommendation system can create a more comprehensive and accurate user profile, leading to more relevant and diverse product recommendations. Multiple-Sources Recommendation is especially useful in situations where limited user data is available or when the recommendation system needs to account for a broader range of factors influencing user preferences.
