# Use Case
There are plenty use cases for Generative AI and new ones are creating every day. Let's see the most common ones.
Based on a [survey from the MLOPS community](https://mlops.community/surveys/llm/) and [this survey from Mckinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai-in-2023-generative-ais-breakout-year) 
the most common use case of AI are the following:
- Create semantic search that can find relevant information in a lot of data. Example: [Slite](https://slite.com/)
- Create chatbots / augmented FAQ that use semantic search and text summarization to answer customer questions. Example: [Quivr](https://www.quivr.app/) is using such similar technology.
- Create personalized content for your customers (product page, emails, messages,...). Example [Carrefour](https://www.carrefour.com/en/news/2023/carrefour-integrates-openai-technologies-and-launches-generative-ai-powered-shopping).
- Create a text summarizer that can summarize a long text into a short one.

Not widely spread yet but with increasing adoption:
- Create personal shopper for augmented ecommerce experience. Example: [Madeline](https://www.knxt-madeline.com/)
- Create AI agent to perform various task autonomously. Example: [AutoGpt](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT)
- Create coding tool that can help you write or revie code. Example: [Code Review GPT](https://github.com/mattzcarey/code-review-gpt)
