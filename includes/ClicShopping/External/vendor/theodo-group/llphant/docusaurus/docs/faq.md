# FAQ
*Why use LLPhant and not directly the OpenAI PHP SDK ?*

The OpenAI PHP SDK is a great tool to interact with the OpenAI API.
LLphant will allow you to perform complex tasks like storing embeddings and perform a similarity search.
It also simplifies the usage of the OpenAI API by providing a much more simple API for everyday usage.
