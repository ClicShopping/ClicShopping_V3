> **Requires [PHP 8.1+](https://php.net/releases/)**

First, install LLPhant via the [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) package manager:

composer require theodo-group/llphant
```
If you want to try the latest features of this library, you can use:
```bash
composer require theodo-group/llphant:dev-main

You may also want to check the requirements for [OpenAI PHP SDK](https://github.com/openai-php/client) as it is the main client.
