# ClicShopping

 Community : https://www.clicshopping.org

 ClicShopping(tm) is an Ecommerce OpenSource Solution B2B / B2C / B2B-B2C. Several configurations can be used.
 The solution is built on modules and APP to have a very big flexibility.
 The approach is completely modular on the catalog / administration with simple code to understand, to customize and to update at need.

 All informations are available at the forum clicshopping.org
 The modules are available on Github (Official and Community) or by an internal install.


 I am looking for a team to continue to develop this application. Programmers, community managers, translators ... All help is welcome.
 If you are interested, contact me and you are welcome in this crazy project :)
